DataFrame.describe() method generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values. This method tells us a lot of things about a dataset. One important thing is that the describe() method deals only with numeric values. It doesn't work with any categorical values. So if there are any categorical values in a column the describe() method will ignore it and display summary for the other columns unless parameter include="all" is passed.

Now, let's understand the statistics that are generated by the describe() method:

count tells us the number of NoN-empty rows in a feature.

mean tells us the mean value of that feature.

std tells us the Standard Deviation Value of that feature.

min tells us the minimum value of that feature.

25%, 50%, and 75% are the percentile/quartile of each features. This quartile

information helps us to detect Outliers.

max tells us the maximum value of that feature.
